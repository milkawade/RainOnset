# RainOnset
This is an android application which tells when rainfall at a particular requested area will most likely start and end.
This is enabled by the analysis of rainfall data of regions provided over a period of not less than 20 years.
Bayesian probabilistic methods are used to calculate the most probable RainOnset date and then cast on to a clender and map.
